# Source Code (src)

This is where the magic happens! Well, the structure of the magic at least.

In a Next.js world, the `src` folder is the heart of our application. We keep things tidy by splitting the code into three main areas:
- `app`: The brains of the operation (routing and pages).
- `components`: The visual building blocks (buttons, sections, layouts).
- `i18n`: How we handle different languages.

Keeping everything in `src` makes the project much easier to maintain and keeps the root directory clean.
