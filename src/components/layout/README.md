# Layout Components

These components provide the structural shell for the site. 

They handle things like:
- Section wrappers (spacing and containers).
- Background effects (gradients, grids).
- Navbars and Footers.

They're designed to be generic so they can wrap any content while keeping the visual style consistent.
