# Components

Components are the reusable pieces of our UI. Think of them like Lego bricks!

We split them up based on how "big" or "specific" they are:
1. `ui`: Small, basic pieces like buttons or social links.
2. `layout`: Structural pieces that help frame the page (grids, sections).
3. `sections`: Larger blocks that make up a whole part of a page (like an "About" or "Services" block).

This "Atomic Design" approach helps us stay organized and avoid repeating ourselves.
