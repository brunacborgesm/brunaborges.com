# Internationalization (i18n)

The site is built to be global! 🌍

We use `react-i18next` to handle translations. This folder contains the configuration and the language files (`locales`) that store all the text for the site. 

By keeping text separate from code, we can easily add new languages or update copy without touching the UI logic.
