# App Router (app)

Since we're using **Next.js App Router**, this folder handles all of our routing. 

Each folder inside corresponds to a URL path (like `/privacy`). We use:
- `page.tsx`: To define the actual content of a page.
- `layout.tsx`: To wrap those pages in consistent elements (like headers or footers).
- `globals.css`: To set the overall look and feel of the site.

In this branch, we've only kept the essential pages to show the structure.
